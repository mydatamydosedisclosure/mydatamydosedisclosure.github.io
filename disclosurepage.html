            Your Privacy and Our Global Operations
            
            My Data, My Dose llc operates in multiple jurisdictions. We process data both inside and outside the United States and Europe and we may share your data among service providers based in countries other than your country of residence. Data entered in the My Data, My Dose llc Services may be transferred to, processed and stored in the United States.
            Safeguards in place to ensure an adequate level of data protection.
            Information collected within the European Economic Area and Switzerland (“EU”) may be transferred, processed, or stored outside the EU as described in this Privacy Policy. If we transfer, process, or store personal information from the EU to or in a country outside the EU, we ensure that safeguards are in place to ensure an adequate level of data protection. These safeguards may be based on a determination by the European Commission or Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner that a country outside the EU has an adequate level of data protection, or on the use of model contract clauses approved by European Union or Swiss data protection authorities.
            
            European Union Rights (GDPR)
            This section applies only to our processing of personal data of EU country residents. It aims to provide increased transparency into our processing, retention, and transfer of EU resident personal data that is in line with the letter and spirit of the General Data Protection Regulation.
            
            In the EU, “Personal Data” is defined very broadly and includes any information about a natural person, who can be identified, directly or indirectly, from data that we hold about them or from data that is combined with other information. EU data protection law requires us to have a legal basis before processing any Personal Data about you.
            
            Our lawful basis for processing personal data covered by this Policy will depend on the purposes of the processing. To the extent we process personal data because it is necessary to perform a contract with you, our legal basis for that processing is that it is necessary for the performance of a contract with you.
            
            When we are required to share personal data with law enforcement agencies or other governmental bodies, or we otherwise process personal data to comply with our legal obligations, we do so on the legal basis that we are under a legal obligation to do so.
            
            We use consent as our basis for processing to the extent required by applicable law, or as we otherwise deem appropriate, for example, before we collect information from you through our app or hardware.
            
            We also process personal data on the lawful basis that it is necessary for My Data, My Dose llc’s legitimate business interests, which may include: providing, improving, and developing our products and services; communicating with and otherwise managing our relationship with you; enhancing the safety and security of our products, services, sites, employees, and others; and protecting My Data, My Dose llc and our business partners from wrongful conduct.
            
            In accordance with applicable laws in the European Union, you have the following rights with respect to your personal data, which apply differently in different circumstances, and may be limited by local law: (i) right of access, (ii) right to correction, (iii) right to erasure, (iv) right to restriction of processing, (v) right to data portability, (vi) right to object to certain types of processing, and (vii) right to withdraw consent to certain types of processing. Most of these rights are not absolute. You may exercise these rights by submitting a request to us. Please note that we may ask for additional information to verify your request before responding to it.
            
            Upon proper request, My Data, My Doses llc will remove all personal data as required, but under GDPR Article 17 (3) (c) and (d) we will be keeping the aggregated data. All users of the My Data, My Doses llc application have the right to update personal information and profiles within the application. My Data, My Doses llc does not sell any personal information with third parties unless the user gives explicit consent. Please use the contact information below for inquiries.
            
            Your personal information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in a country other than the one in which it was collected, including the United States. For example, we may store your data on a server in the United States because that is where a particular database is hosted; and that data may be “transferred” again for permitted processing. We perform such transfers using contractual protections that EU regulators have pre-approved to ensure your data is protected (known as model contract clauses).
            While we hope that we can resolve any query or concern you raise about our use of your information, the General Data Protection Regulation also gives you right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the European Union (or European Economic Area) state where you work, normally live, or where any alleged infringement of data protection laws occurred.
            
            You may contact My Data, My Dose llc’s data protection officer regarding any issues related to processing of your personal information and to exercise your rights under applicable law regarding the processing of your personal information.
